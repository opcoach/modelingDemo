This git repository contains some steps for an Eclipse Modeling Project demo. 

It starts from an ecore model of an urban city transportation network and then it creates all what we can expect from modeling project : 
default EMF Editor
good code generation using genModelAddon
some code generator using xtend
integration in the EMF generated editor or any other editor
a sirius representation of the network
a xtext description of a city file to describe the network with text
